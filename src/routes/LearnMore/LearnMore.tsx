        What is a 'Wink Mod?'
      </h1>
      <p className="wink-mod-description">
        A 'Wink Mod' refers to the ability to wink your Miata's headlights. This means 'blinking' one headlight instead of both.
        Often times people also include the ability to move the headlights to an arbitrary position, rather than all the way in one direction. This is referred to as 'Sleepy Eye.'
        Winking is often done by disconnecting one of the headlight connectors, to only allow one headlight to operate normally.
        While this does achieve the goal of 'Winking' the headlights, this is both inefficient, and dangerous.
