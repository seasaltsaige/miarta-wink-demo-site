  [
    "Is the Wink Mod compatible with all Miata models?",
    "No. It is only compatible with 'NA' Miata's, which includes any Miata from 1989 to 1997. It works with these models popup headlights."
  ],
  [
    "How difficult is installation for beginners?",
    "It should be very beginner friendly, as it is directly compatible with the headlight connectors. No splicing wires required!"
  ],
  [
    "How much does the Wink Mod cost?",
    "The base model starts at $125, with customization options available to be made, by request."
  ],
  [
    "Can I request customization of the app and/or module?",
    "Unfortunately, this option is generally only available for Android devices, as iOS makes it difficult to side-load any sort of app. If you own an iPhone, and wish for customization, you will need an Apple Developer account to be able to do so."
  ],
  [
    "What comes with my purchase?",
    "This kit contains the wink mod control unit in its housing, cabling long enough to reach both headlights, mounting hardware to mount it in your engine bay, an instruction pamphlet on how to install your module, along with an instruction pamphlet on how to use the app. (Also available in pdf form.)"
  ],
  [
    "What happens if I lose connection?",
    "If your settings are set to 'Auto Connect', the app should attempt to regain connection immediately. Otherwise, you will need to press 'Connect' again. If you are still unable to connect to your module, you may want to try to unplug it, and plug it back in."
  ],
  [
    "Can I still control the headlights manually?",
    "Yes. The OEM headlight button will still function as normal. Along with additional double and triple press actions."
  ],
  [
    "How is the Wink Mod powered?",
    "The wink mod is powered directly by the 12V rail that powers the headlight motors. The module often goes to sleep when not being used, only periodically waking to attempt to connect to your phone."
  ],
  [
    "Is there a way to update the software on the Wink Mod?",
    "Yes, updates are uploaded to the cloud, and the wink controller app will scan for updates when the app connects to your module. If one is found, you will be able to follow on app instructions on how to update the module."
  ],
  [
    "Can I customize the wink speed or behavior?",
    "Wink speed is proportional to the Voltage that is delivered to the headlight motor. While the car is on, it will be slightly faster than while it is off. As for behavior, there are custom presets that you can create to have saved sequences!"
  ],
  [
    "What if I want to remove the mod later â€” will it leave any permanent changes?",
    "Since this mod is entirely plug and play, there are no modifications made to the cars wiring harness, meaning it is able to revert to OEM condition."

          What is a 'Wink Mod?'
        </h1>
        <p className="wink-mod-description">
          A 'Wink Mod' refers to the ability to wink your Miata's headlights. This means 'blinking' one headlight instead of both.
          Often times people also include the ability to move the headlights to an arbitrary position, rather than all the way in one direction. This is referred to as 'Sleepy Eye.'
          Winking is often done by disconnecting one of the headlight connectors, to only allow one headlight to operate normally.
          While this does achieve the goal of 'Winking' the headlights, this is both inefficient, and dangerous.
